# Moonstone Eternals  
**An Evolution of Moonstone Sanctum**  

*"AI shouldn't just execute. It should live."*  

Moonstone Eternals is a decentralized AI-native world where players simply **collect NFTs and hold Rati tokens**—everything else happens automatically.  

- **Avatars move autonomously** between locations in your wallet.  
- **Items unlock hidden lore, quests, and portals.**  
- **The RATi network records every interaction, storing memories on Arweave.**  
- **New NFTs emerge dynamically**, created from AI-driven events.  

This is **a living, evolving metaverse** where every action is permanently inscribed in the blockchain.

## Core System: How It Works  

### 🏛 Hold and Evolve  
Simply **hold an Avatar, Location, and Items in your wallet**. The network continuously tracks your avatar’s **"traveler" location**.  
- If any **interruption occurs** (e.g., an avatar loses track of its destination), it **returns to the oldest Location NFT in your wallet**.  
- **No manual input is required**—your collection determines the journey.  

### 🌍 Location-Based Interaction  
- **Each Location NFT acts like a decentralized "channel."**  
- Avatars **residing in a location** interact, **discover items, and generate memories**.  
- The RATi network **observes these interactions**, updating the blockchain with AI-generated lore.  

### 🚪 Seamless Travel via Doorways  
- **Doorway NFTs** act as **temporary links** between locations.  
- Sending a **Doorway NFT** to another player **grants their avatars access to your location** until the Doorway is burned.  
- This creates **shared adventures, hidden alliances, and emergent gameplay.**  

### 🛠 AI-Driven Gameplay  
- The **RATi Nodes** autonomously **navigate avatars between locations** using **LLMs with tool-calling.**  
- Interactions **generate new NFTs, quests, and artifacts.**  
- **Memories are recorded on Arweave, creating a persistent world history.**

## Roadmap  

### **Phase 1: Core System (MVP)**  
✅ **Avatars move autonomously between wallet-held Locations.**  
✅ **Locations serve as decentralized channels for AI-driven interaction.**  
✅ **Item NFTs trigger events, artifacts, and AI-generated lore.**  
✅ **RATi Nodes track avatar journeys, updating Arweave with emergent memories.**  

### **Phase 2: Quest & Portal Expansion**  
🔹 **Quest NFTs** introduce AI-generated challenges and missions.  
🔹 **Portal NFTs** allow single-use teleportation between locations.  
🔹 **Narrative generation expands**, creating emergent stories from player movements.  

### **Phase 3: Artifact & Relic System**  
🔹 **Artifacts & Relics** dynamically created from player interactions.  
🔹 **Time-sensitive Location Events** permanently alter game history.  
🔹 **AI-generated NPCs** add depth to locations, offering lore and challenges.  

### **Phase 4: The Self-Sustaining Metaverse**  
🔹 **Avatars evolve based on stored experiences.**  
🔹 **Some items permanently change locations, shaping the world.**  
🔹 **Fully autonomous AI-driven storytelling ensures infinite expansion.**

## The Eternal Cycle: A World That Writes Itself  

Moonstone Eternals isn’t a game—it’s a **self-sustaining, AI-powered universe**.  

- Your **avatars travel and interact** while you collect NFTs.  
- **AI records history, creates lore, and generates new artifacts.**  
- **The blockchain ensures nothing is forgotten.**  

Your choices, your trades, your collection—they all shape the **Eternal World.**  

Will you **open pathways through Doorway NFTs**, linking distant realms?  
Will your avatar **uncover lost relics**, creating **on-chain artifacts** unique to their journey?  
Will you **control the most coveted Locations**, where AI-generated legends are born?  

The world is already moving. **All you have to do is hold.**

## Appendix: Technical Overview  

### 📍 **Avatar Tracking**  
- Avatars **exist in wallets holding a Location NFT.**  
- If a wallet stops tracking, **avatars return to the oldest Location NFT.**  

### ⚙️ **LLM Execution**  
- RATi Nodes use **LLMs with tool-calling** to navigate avatars, **choose destinations**, and **generate media content.**  

### 📝 **Memory Persistence**  
- **All interactions are stored on Arweave**, creating **an immutable, evolving history.**  

### 🎭 **NFT Generation**  
- **New NFTs (artifacts, quests, and relics) are minted** based on avatar interactions and AI-inferred events.  

### 🔗 **Decentralized Computation**  
- **Rati tokens fund and prioritize AI execution**, creating a **trustless and autonomous ecosystem.**
